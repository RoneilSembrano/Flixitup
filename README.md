### Notes
I was confused about using the API key but regardless it doesn't ever change. Also, task.resume() was something I left out that wasn't retrieving the movies from the api to my movies array. Another issue I had was with posterView not being UIImageView. The reason was because I control dragged and was accidentally accessing the collection view.

### Notes
It was challenging remembering to set the identifier in the two locations for MovieCell. Also, I struggled with reading the api and getting the JSON to work. I had minor issues installing cocoapods but a retry seemed to work. Source control was difficult in the beginning but learning to work with the terminal has improved efficiency.
